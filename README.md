# Spark_With_ML
In the "Spark With ML" project, I built a linear regression model using PySpark to predict the median home values.

Since the dataset was clean, there was no need for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) process.

I calculated the correlation between each independent variable and the dependent variable, then dropped the less correlated variables, focusing only on the most significant ones. The model achieved strong performance with a high RÂ² value and a low RMSE, indicating its accuracy in predicting home prices.
